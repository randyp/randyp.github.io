## Please Do Not Feed The Code Monkeys
#### 2020-02-21 by Randy Pensinger

Do you develop software?
Do you feed the Code Monkeys?
Not sure what the Code Monkeys are?
I can explain.

Inside each software developer exists the Code Monkeys, gods of degenerate software development.
The Code Monkeys are not instrinsically bad, just unevolved and ill-suited to team software development.

Have you ever been asked a question about some code you didn't write and you redirected the question to someone else... and you never learned about the answer?
Or maybe someone asked you a question and you told them they didn't need to know the answer?
Or maybe you had to use a new software library and you copy+pasted some code without understanding what it does?
Or maybe a team member was writing code they didn't understand... and you didn't help them understand?
Those were the Code Monkeys, who are not curious enough and don't share what curiousity they have.

Have you ever started working on a new application page without fully understanding who was going to use the page and how?
Or maybe you knew who was going to use the page but you never met them?
Or maybe you knew how they were going to use the page because you were going to design the page to be used a certain way?
Or maybe you designed a page but never used it and never watched someone use the page?
Those were also the Code Monkeys, who don't proactively collaborate enough and consider others when building software.

Have you ever written a function or program that did something unexpected, and you couldn't explain what was happening?
And you never followed up because the function wasn't important?
Or you didn't have enought time?
And now that code is in production...
Or maybe you don't know what the function actually does because you didn't test it?
Also the damn Code Monkeys! They have trouble comprehending consequences or pretend they don't exist because the consequences don't affect them.

In short, Code Monkeys are not a curious, social, evolved beings capable of truly great software.
Instead the Code Monkeys furiously author thousands of lines of code of questionable quality, perhaps eager to please The Boss Monkeys.
Don't even get me started on the Boss Monkeys.

All software developers have _fed the Code Monkeys_.
If you have worked with me I have seen you feed the Code Monkeys and you have seen me do the same.
There are also Boss Monkeys, Gant Chart Monkeys, et cetera.
Don't even get me started on the Boss Monkeys.

Thankfully I feel I have been feeding the Code Monkeys less frequently over time.
I feel I can say the same with the people I have been working with.

I have found no shortage of advice.
A great example of a blog post is Jeff Atwood's [Sharing The Customer's Pain](https://blog.codinghorror.com/sharing-the-customers-pain/).
And I have seen many other great examples.
Our Code Monkeys have had fewer and fewer places to hide as we have disciplined ourselves and each other.

Here is my advice based on quirky comprehension.

### Curiousity
More to come here.

### Collaboration
More to come here.

### Accountability
More to come here.
