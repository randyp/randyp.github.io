<p>Do you write software?
Do you feed the Code Monkeys?
Not sure who the Code Monkeys are?
I can explain.</p>
<p>The Code Monkeys are the root of our natural predispositions and learned habits which bias us towards degenerate software engineering.
They are chaotic demons who reside in each person.
They whisper lies, omit the truth and tempt people to programming sin.
Through their influence the Code Monkeys spoil a software project&#39;s fate.
Sometimes they playfully pluck at the fate, satisfied with a high bug count, but just as often they doom they project.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t believe me?
How else could one explain such high software project failure rates?
I&#39;ve seen published estimates of failure rates starting at 15% and as high as 80%.
I subscribe to the Standish Group’s 2020 CHAOS report which estimates that around 66% of software projects fail.
Someone is responsible for a large portion of those failures.
I blame the Code Monkeys.</p>
<p>Of course the Code Monkeys aren&#39;t literal demons.
The Code Monkeys are people&#39;s base instincts and unevolved traits.
These instincts and traits are ill-suited for software engineering and teams, and it is through knowledge and discipline that we can nullify their influence.</p>
<p>Have you ever copy+pasted some code you didn&#39;t understand?
Or maybe a team member was writing code they didn&#39;t understand... and you didn&#39;t help them understand?
Or have you been asked a question about some code you didn&#39;t write, you redirected the question but never learned the answer yourself?
Or maybe someone asked you a question, and you told them they didn&#39;t need to know the answer?
That was the Code Monkeys, who are not curious.</p>
<p>Have you ever started working on a new application page without fully understanding who was going to use the page and how they were going to use it?
Or maybe you knew who was going to use the page, but you never met them?
And you knew how they were going to use the page because you designed the page to be used a certain way?
Or maybe you designed a page which you never watched someone using the page?
That was also the Code Monkeys, who don&#39;t collaborate.</p>
<p>Have you ever written a function or program that did something unexpected, and you couldn&#39;t explain what was happening?
And you never followed up because the function wasn&#39;t important?
Or you didn&#39;t have enough time?
And now that code is in production...
Or maybe you don&#39;t know what the function actually does because you did not test it?
Also the damn Code Monkeys! They have no discipline.</p>
<p>In short, the Code Monkeys are not a curious, collaborative, disciplined beings capable of truly great software.</p>
<p>All software engineers have <em>fed the Code Monkeys</em>.
If you have worked with me then I have seen you feed the Code Monkeys and you have seen me do the same.
There are also Boss Monkeys, Gant Chart Monkeys, <em>et cetera</em>.
Don&#39;t even get me started on The Boss Monkeys.</p>
<p>Thankfully I feel I have been feeding the Code Monkeys less frequently over time.
I feel I can say the same for the people work with.
I have found no shortage of advice on how to restrain the Code Monkeys.
With regard to curiosity, collaboration and discipline I would like to refer you to a few resources with my own introductions and perspective.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>I&#39;m certain beyond doubt that curiosity and creativity are two sides of the same coin and share the same processes.
John Cleese&#39;s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g">Creativity in Management</a> is the best resource I have found to foster curiosity, except that you will have to mentally replace the word &quot;creative&quot; with &quot;curious&quot; in his talk.
To summarize his talk (applied to curiosity):</p>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity is not a talent.</li>
<li>Curiosity does not come from the closed mode, which is when you are focused.</li>
<li>Curious people are able to play. Curious people can ask &quot;What if?&quot; and &quot;How?&quot;.</li>
<li>To be curious you must enter the open mode by giving yourself &quot;space, time, time, confidence and humor&quot;.</li>
<li>Use the open mode to ask the right questions, use the closed mode to work once you have an answer. Repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to Cleese&#39;s talk I don&#39;t need to relax for 30 minutes each time I need to be curious or creative.
Only for the most complicated problems do I have to sit on my thumbs until my mind relaxes.
But I do need some or all of the components of &quot;space, time, time, confidence and humor&quot; to start the process.
I suspect the same applies to others. </p>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>The primary benefit of collaboration is empathy, not creativity.
Collaboration is about <em>working together</em> towards a <em>common goal</em>.
Creativity solves problems but empathy is essential to define the problems.
Defining the problems starts by understanding the context, <em>id est</em> the customers and what they are trying to accomplish.
Software written without context is called <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/ivory-tower-development/">ivory tower software development</a> and leads to software which doesn&#39;t solve the customer&#39;s problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/sharing-the-customers-pain/">Sharing The Customer&#39;s Pain</a> is a great article on keeping in touch with your customers by &quot;manning the support desk&quot;.
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/05/05/what-is-the-work-of-dogs-in-this-country/">Dogfooding</a>, using your own software, is an asocial form collaboration.
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shadowing.asp">Shadowing</a> is a mix of the previous two.
All approaches build empathy for the customer.
Sharing the customers pain is a social, reactive technique for building empathy.
Dogfooding is an asocial, proactive technique for building empathy.
Shadowing is a social, proactive technique for building empathy.</p>
<p>Group design and planning is a difficult skill for which I don&#39;t have a specific article I can recommend.
I feel people often confuse group design as the only form of collaboration.
As long as you are <em>working together</em> towards a <em>common goal</em> you are collaborating, and group design is not always required.
My time at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mediaalpha/mycompany/verification/">MediaAlpha</a> has taught me building empathy often allows me to anticipate our common goal so that I can implement a proof-of-concept for review by the customer.
Reviewing your POC with your customer is a great way to build empathy!</p>
<p>When you decide to design and plan in a group I think the most important aspect you can control is your own behavior.
I&#39;ll again refer you to John Cleese&#39;s talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g">Creativity in Management</a> for how to behave in group planning.
Beyond that, perhaps unstructured meetings are best for building empathy as well as creativity.</p>
