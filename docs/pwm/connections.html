      <p>Dear Brave Family,</p>
      <p>Okay, so, slight change of plans: I’ve been captured.</p>
      <p>By what, you ask? Oh, nothing too alarming… just large, hairy creatures that smell like a mix of wet dog, burnt toast, and regret. They’re definitely not human. Beyond that, I’m still figuring it out.</p>
      <p>They don’t seem particularly violent—just really confused. Honestly, I think they tried to solve my puzzles but, uh… let’s just say “logical reasoning” isn’t exactly their specialty. They’ve been staring at the puzzles the way I stare at my phone when it refuses to unlock because of a smudge.</p>
      <p>Since they can’t figure out the puzzles, I’m hiding clues inside them. If you’re reading this, it means you’re my best hope!</p>
      <p><b>Please rescue me!,</b></p>
      <p>Crack the puzzles, follow the clues, and find me before I become the centerpiece of some hairy banquet or get shipped off to a mystery destination I do not want to discover.</p>
      <p>No pressure, though. You’ve totally got this. Probably.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>Randy</p>
